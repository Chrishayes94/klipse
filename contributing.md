Klipse is written in Clojurescript.


# How to run locally

from the terminal:

```bash
clj -A:figwheel --build dev --repl
```


From cider, you should tell cider to launch clj with `:fig-cider` alias so that figwheel-main libs are loadeine that cider builds.

Then, open the browser [http://localhost:5014/js-dbg.html](http://localhost:5014/js-dbg.html)

From now on, the code is auto-compiled on every changes.
You might need to refreh the test page to make sure the code changes were applied.
